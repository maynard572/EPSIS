The folder named "workingFolder" should contain all the scripts, and small data files used in the experiments
Please note that large data files should not be uploaded as that isnt in the spirit of Git Hub 
and we will be "encouraged" to remove them!

You can add additional sub-folders as you wish - there is no further "imposed" structure
