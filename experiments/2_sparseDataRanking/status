Results:
As is typical, the non-Proper scores perform poorly: MSE never picks the correct forecast 
(in fact it always picks the narrow distribution - not shown) and the Naive Linear score does little better.
Apart from situations with very few observations (i.e. two or less) Ignorance performs best out of all the score types. 
CRPS has similar performance to the power rule score with α = 1.5. 
As the α parameter increases the success rate for the power rule decreases. 
Amongst Proper scores the Spherical score performs worse for larger sample sizes.

High level experiment description:
This experiment tests how well skill scores perform when the observations form a sparse data set.  The (hypothetical)
underlying is a unit normal distribution;  three forecasts are produced named: Narrow, Perfect and Wide - each also being
gaussian but with varying standard deviation. A given forecast is chosen if it has the best score over the sparse hypothetical
observations. The experiment is repeated multiple times and the proportion of times the perfect forecast is chosen gives an 
objective measure of how well the skill score has peformed (i.e. if a skill score leads to an incorrect forecast being chosen
regularly then it has not performed well).  The experiment is carried out for multiple skill scores to produce a ranking in 
this context.
