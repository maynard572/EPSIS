Results:
The following scores have the Feasibility property: 
• Ignorance
• Naive linear
• Proper linear
• Power rule
• Spherical
• Brier

The following scores do not have the Feasibility property: 
• CRPS
• MSE

On the presumption that the Feasibility property is considered desirable the CRPS and MSE are therefore of low rank on this
basis.


High level experiment summary:
The Feasibility property highlights that certain scores tend to assign good values to forecasts that assign high probability
to events that are near impossible. If Feasibility is accepted as a desirable property then scores which do not posses this
property should be passed over in favour of those that do. Specifically the Mean Squared Error and CRPS scores are not
‘Feasible’ and would therefore have a low rank according to this criteria.
