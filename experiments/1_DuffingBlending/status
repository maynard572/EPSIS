Results: 
• The Ignorance score does best at choosing parameters that are close to the true kernel width;
• Amongst the Proper scores the CRPS does worst;
• The Improper Naive Linear score never outperforms the Ignorance score but does occasionally beat the other Proper scores;
• The Improper Mean Squared Error score does worst;
• The Proper Linear, Power Rule and Spherical scores all have similar performance in this test;
• As α gets smaller the power rule score performs better on this test.
• The RMSE statistic is deeply flawed in this section, is non-proper and systematically fails



High level experiment description:
  A hypothetical underlying distribution is created by kernel dressing a sample of output from the Duffing distribution and a
  family of probability forecasts is created one of which will exactly match the underlying.  The key parameter which indexes
  the forecasts is the kernel width.  Samples from the underlying are taken and optimum score estimation is used to choose the
  forecast with the best score given the sample.  The choice of the forecast is equivalent to estimating the kernel width
  which can be compared to the true kernel width of the underlying.   The difference between the chosen kernel width and the
  true value is an objective measure of how well the skill score has performed.  This allows different scores to be compared.
