Results:
• An initially surprising result, all the scores apart from the Ignorance score have the same Rejection Times. 
This is because the extensions of the Naive Linear score all involve integral terms that are constant for a given forecast, 
these cause the Skill Gap of these related scores to be scalar multiples of one another and hence the same Rejection Times 
arise (see paper)
• For all scores, the further truth is from the forecast the faster the forecast system will be rejected.
• Ignorance gives a shorter Rejection Time when the truth is HybridPareto - but the Naive Linear, ProperLinear 
and Spherical do better (in some cases much better) when the truth is Lognormal like. 
• This leads to a key conclusion that using multiple scores would be useful in some contexts.



High level experiment description:
The Skill Gap is a generalisation of the Information Deficit which compares how close a score is to its expected value.  
For a given series of forecasts the distribution of the skill gap can be estimated and this allows an erroneous forecast
to be rejected after a certain time if the observed value falls outside of a pre-selected level of signficance.  A family
of underlying distributions indexed within a triangle of parameters is created, each member of this family can also act as
a forecast for any member of the family.  For each pair forecast/underlying the rejection time is calculated (having specified
a level of confidence and significance).  This allows an objective measure of skill score performance (i.e. a skill score that 
takes a long time to reject an erroneous forecast has performed "badly") - which allows comparison of different skill scores.
